### 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW 🚨

**IMPORTANT**: Every time we update code on GitHub and deploy to Vercel, follow this process:

1. **After Git Push**: Verify changes are pushed to GitHub repository
2. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: Go to Vercel app dashboard
3. **Verify Latest Commit**: Ensure the latest commit number matches your GitHub push
4. **Manual Promotion Required**: 
   - Click the **options menu** (⋯) in the upper right navigation of Vercel app
   - Select **"PROMOTE TO PRODUCTION"**
   - This step is MANDATORY - deployments don't automatically go to production

**Why This Matters**:
- Vercel creates preview deployments by default
- Production deployment requires manual promotion
- Users won't see changes until promoted to production
- Always verify the commit hash matches before promoting

**Deployment Verification Steps**:
1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
2. ✅ Vercel build completes successfully
3. ✅ Latest commit hash verified
4. ✅ **PROMOTE TO PRODUCTION** clicked
5. ✅ Production URL updated and tested

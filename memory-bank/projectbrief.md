# Community College Matcher - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A comprehensive AI-powered web application that helps students find and match with community colleges based on their personal preferences, academic interests, career goals, and practical constraints.

## Core Mission
Democratize access to community college education by providing personalized, intelligent matching that considers the whole student - not just academics, but financial constraints, geographic preferences, schedule needs, and life circumstances.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Prospective community college students of all ages
- **Secondary**: Career changers, working professionals, military veterans
- **Tertiary**: Parents/guardians helping students make decisions

## Key Value Propositions
1. **Personalized Matching**: AI-driven algorithm that weighs multiple factors (financial, geographic, academic, lifestyle)
2. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Holistic student profiling beyond just test scores
3. **Practical Focus**: Real-world considerations like transportation, work schedules, family obligations
4. **AI Counselor**: 24/7 intelligent guidance and support
5. **Visual Tools**: Interactive maps, financial calculators, application tracking

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Student assessment questionnaire with comprehensive profiling
- AI-powered matching algorithm with weighted scoring
- Interactive college results with detailed match explanations
- Geographic visualization with distance calculations
- Financial planning and cost comparison tools
- AI chat counselor for personalized guidance
- Application tracking and deadline management

### Technical Requirements
- Next.js 15 with React 19 for modern web performance
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible design
- OpenAI integration for AI counselor functionality
- Leaflet maps for geographic visualization
- Responsive design for all device types

### Performance Requirements

- Quality of match recommendations (user feedback)
- AI counselor interaction satisfaction
- Application conversion rates
- User retention and return visits

## Project Constraints
- Focus on community colleges only (not 4-year institutions)
- Must work with mock data initially (real college API integration later)
- Budget-conscious target audience requires cost-effective solutions
- Accessibility compliance for diverse user base

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components

## Project Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core matching system with basic UI ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced features (maps, financial tools, chat) ✅
3. **Phase 3**: Polish, optimization, and real data integration
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (saved searches, notifications, etc.)

## Current Status
Phase 2 complete - all core features implemented with mock data. Ready for optimization and real data integration.
